- Styling with ***Tailwind CSS***
- Static & ***Dynamic (Conditional)*** Styling



## 1. Vanilla CSS

    -> It's the basic way of styling react component by writting CSS rules in a single CSS file or multiple CSS files and importing it into React Component

    
### 1.1 Advantages of Vanilla CSS

- CSS code is decoupled from JSX Code

- you write CSS code as you (maybe) know and (maybe) love it

- CSS code can be written by another developer who needs only a minimal amount of access to your JSX code.


### 1.2 Disadvantages of Vanilla CSS

- You need to know CSS

- CSS code is not scoped to components

- CSS rules may clash across components (e.g: same CSS class name used in different components for different purposes).
